    <h2>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current electricity supply system.</h2>
    
    <h2>Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own.  </h2>
    
    <h2>Tesla left Edison Machine Works because he believed that Alternating currents would be very safe to provide electricity to many homes and builings while Edison believed in Direct Currents,This period was known as the "WAR OF CURRENTS".He invented the first alternating current (AC) motor and developed AC generation and transmission technology.Today AC Motors power our homes while DC Motors power up small electrical devices like: Electrical ToothBrush.</h2>
